# Decentralized Censorship-Resistant News Evaluation Application

## Background

In the last few years, we see the rise of the "fake news" label given to news pieces deemed misleading. While the effort to label potentially misleading news pieces might seem laudable, we see more recently that such effort has also led to those with certain agenda using this label and pushing for pieces not in line with their agenda to be censored. This has poisoned healthy public discourse.

One example: in the beginning of COVID-19, some people brought up the possibility that COVID-19 might have come out of a leak from a laboratory in China. Any articles bringing up this theory was labeled with misleading tag in the major social media platforms. However, more recently, this theory is deemed to be more and more plausible, and hence the misleading label applied earlier might seem premature.

## Mechanism Design

In the application, a user can have a couple of roles:

- proposer: propose a news piece to be evaluated
- evaluator: evaluate a news piece

To facilitate meaningful activities, it is important to design the mechanism so that the incentives of the users are aligned properly. To achieve this, we propose a reward/punishment mechanisms using tokens specific to the app.
